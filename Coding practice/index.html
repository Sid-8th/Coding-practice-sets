Known for his courage, loyalty and devotion, Ram is a symbol of perseverance and justice and a role model of the perfect human being. He is considered the embodiment of righteousness, devotion, and sacrifice. His life is the epitome of values and principles that are revered by millions of people across the world.
        Ram is known as the son of Lord Surya and Seventh Avatar of Vishnu in Hinduism. However, in Valmiki Ramayana, he was the son of Lord Sun (also surya). When king Dashrath conducted the sacrifice, lord sun presented his portion Rama. Rama's character purely resembles Karna(the chief protagonist of the Mahabharata).
        Lord Ram was born as the eldest son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya and his first wife, Queen Kausalya. His birth is still celebrated as Ram Navami with great joy and enthusiasm as he is considered the one who would bring peace and prosperity to all our lives.
